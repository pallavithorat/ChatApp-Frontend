**ChatApp - MongoDB | Express.js | React.js | Node.js**

ChatApp is a modern web application designed for real-time messaging, built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This README provides an overview of the architecture, data models, and installation instructions for the project.

**Short Description**

The ChatApp is a comprehensive messaging platform designed to facilitate real-time communication between users. The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and incorporates additional technologies like Socket.IO for real-time communication and JWT for secure authentication. The project is actively maintained, with new features and improvements added regularly.


**Frontend**

Framework: React.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Hosting: Vercel

**Backend**

Framework: Express.js
API: RESTful API
Database: MongoDB
Real-time Communication: Socket.IO
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

**Technology Stack**

Primary Technologies
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data and chat messages.
Express.js: Node.js framework for building the backend API.
React.js: JavaScript library for building the frontend user interface.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for running the server-side code.
Additional Technologies

JWT (JSON Web Token): Used for secure authentication and authorization.







# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
